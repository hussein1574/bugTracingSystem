# Bug Tracing System

This is a Java project that includes a JFrame-based user interface and a MySQL database. It's designed to facilitate communication between testers and developers, allowing testers to assign bugs to developers and project managers to track bug statuses.

## How it works

The Bug Tracking System is a simple application that provides an interface for testers to report bugs and for developers to track and resolve them. When a tester encounters a bug, they can create a new bug report and assign it to a developer. The developer can then update the status of the bug as they work on it, and mark it as resolved when they've fixed the problem. Project managers can view all the bug reports and their statuses, allowing them to track the progress of the project.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later

2. Import the `database file\bugTracingSystem.sql` file into your MySQL database.
3. Open the project in an IDE (e.g., Eclipse, NetBeans).

5. Build and run the project.
